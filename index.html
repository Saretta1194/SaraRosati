        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m Sara, a curious and determined person with a strong background in the restaurant industry and a growing passion for technology.  
            After years of working under pressure in professional kitchens, I decided to challenge myself with something completely new: software development.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe that creativity, problem-solving, and resilience — the skills I developed every day in the kitchen — are just as essential in the tech world.  
            I’m currently studying Full Stack Development, learning to build real-world web applications with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I love continuous learning, solving problems, and transforming ideas into functional, user-friendly websites.  
        </p>
